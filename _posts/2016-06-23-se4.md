This week, we went to [Justworks](http://justworks.com) to see how engineers and benefits specialists are working together to streamline Human Resources for small and mid-size business across America.

We learned about self-directed teams, culture, remote work (and robots!), the tech stack (Ruby on Rails, AWS, MySQL, Redshift, React), and more.
