[Last week's episode about technical interview](https://youtu.be/GBp0yIdJtUk) was a hit, so we asked Kevin to come back and show us how to solve a common hypothetical interview question. He suggested one of his favorites: programming the classic board game Battleship.

There are three parts to the solution: rules & assumptions, setup (placing ships on the board), and  missile firing (calculating hits). Got questions? Post them on YouTube!
