**[In our debut rankings report](http://studenthackers.devpost.com)**, we've ranked the technologies which student hackers used most throughout the 2014-2015 academic year. We looked at project tags from a sample of 13,281 student hackers who participated in 160 student hackathons and submitted 9,898 projects, either in hackathons or on their Devpost portfolios.

<a href="http://devpost.com">Devpost</a> (<a href="http://blog.devpost.com/post/125253916364/challengepost-is-now-devpost">formerly ChallengePost</a>) is the home for hackers &mdash; a community where developers can share their software projects, build their portfolios, and compete in online and in-person hackathons.

Devpost's digital infrastructure is used at student hackathons around the world and leading engineering schools in the U.S.  As a result, student hackers have a big presence in our community. Whether in high school or college, novice or veteran, they are at the forefront of software (and often hardware) innovation, showing equal interest in both academic and consumer oriented endeavors.
